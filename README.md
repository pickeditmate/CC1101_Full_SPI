# CC11XX Library that supports full SPI

## Description:
This is a library that I'm using to get Full SPI working with Transactions. It currently works with a Teensy 3.1/3.2. I'm going to also test this on other platforms like Cortex M0's, Espressif ESP8266, Espressif ESP32, etc. I'm up to any recommendations on other platforms to make it compatible with. 

I don't take full credit for this project, as I have just taken other peoples work, and started experimenting to make it work correctly. I have found other SPI libraries for the CC11xx but none seem to work, or outdated. My goal is to get this working fully. Works today on a Teensy 3.1/3.2 but that is all I have tested it on. I'm having some small random issues currently, but will fix those before moving onto other platforms.


## Features:
- Arduino code to get everything running
- Full SPI Support

## Known Working MCU - Send only right now
- Teensy 3.1/3.2
- Teensy LC
- Teensy 3.5/3.6
- Espressif ESP32


## Future:
- Compatibility
- Multiple CC11xx modules (Maybe)
